1) Good morning everybody this is a presentation of Finite Theory and gravitomagnetism that replaces General Relativity at all scales from the solar system scale to the visible Universe to the greater invisible universe.

2.1) Here we see the traditional light bending experiment that was done earlier in 1919 this century where we see that General Relativity light bending prediction is twice as much as the Newtonian light bending. But I have to say that the General Relativity was already adjusted by the perihelion procession in the first place so it's not really a prediction so there's room for a discussion over there already.

2.2) The gravitational redshift we see here a laser bouncing back and forth on the mirror starting in red is going to blue shift when the elevator goes down in altitude so basically the General Relativity's redshift refutes the Special Relativity's locality postulate.

2.3) Regarding the black holes, we see that black holes are either singularity or wormholes in General Relativity so if there's a black hole collision then we'll end up with another singularity quite simply so that's the prediction the General Relativity comes up with.

2.4) Regarding the inflation of the universe General Relativity predicts that the universe inflates like a bread in an oven but it also loses energy so we don't really know what happens to this energy there. It breaks the laws of the conservation of energy right so you know that General Relativity just fails at this scale already.

3.1) So regarding Finite Theory and gravitomagnetism I have to start with the measurement units of gravitomagnetism because they're much simpler than what is written in the textbooks. If you simplify the measurement units you end up with the some similarities with the electric and gravitoelectric field which is the standard gravity, magnetic and the gravitomagnetic field; where you just add a factor here which is the ratio of the kg and the Coulomb that you need to multiply with or divide with to convert one with the other. But it's basically the same measurement units there's no big difference there. We also see below the apparatus in development, to generate a gravitomagnetic field which will be inducing a simple gravity vector at the same time.

3.2.1) So regarding the galactic rotation curves, here is the extremely simple and clean equation I use to represent them. It consists of the main orbital velocity factored by the time dilation and slightly altered by its own spin as well. Because remember that with Finite Theory, objects do have their own superposed comoving gravitational framework which will emerge with massive objects such as the galactic bulges.

3.2.2) About the radii range and mass of the visible universe, if we take the inside-the-sphere gravitational potential distribution formula of the entire visible universe, the mass density of the visible universe, and the volume of a sphere, we'll end up with the following possible radii range and mass ranges, or 2 x 10^23 m and 2 x 10^43 kg respectively. That's 2000 times lesser than the radius estimated by mainstream science regarding the radii and 100 million times lesser than the mass estimated by mainstream science.

3.2.3) With that information and some mathematics on the Hubble's constant, we can solve the maximum velocity of the visible universe, which would be around 637,320 m/s.

3.2.4) Regarding the the energy density and the acceleration of the visible universe, I use the energy density here of a photon where we see the electric field and the gravitomagnetic field here equals to the Plank constant times frequency times N, where N compensates to the the density of the energy, where the density of the energy really is the frequency or the gravitomagnetic field divided by the gravity permeability and the Plank constant. The electric field and the magnetic field can be also be decomposed into the KC constant which is the square root of the electromagnetic permeability divided by the gravity permeability, and is what I call the the KC constant. And when we decompose that equation here there's also another an important property where the electric energy density equals the magnetic energy density so one equals to the other so we can we can simply use the middle formula then at the bottom here where the electric field is equals to the magnetic field times the speed of light or the gravitoelectric field equals the gravitomagnetic fields times the speed of light. It turns out the acceleration of the visible universe is: 6.7 x 10^-10 m/s^2. Furthermore just with the simple equation we can deduce a lot of properties of the speed of light and here we see in the bottom here the gravitational redshift.

3.4.5) What is left to deduce of the position of the "universal core", of the enomous mass that creates the gravitational potential differential the visible universe is traveling through. So if we take the "simplified" Newtonian acceleration equation where we strip out the mass of the visible universe, we'll end up with: a_universe = G x M_core / s_core^2. By definition in Finite Theory, G also equals to: G = c^2 / h_invisible, and where h_invisible at that scale simply is: h_invisible = M_core / s_core (or simply the gravitational potential without the G constant). Since we already know the acceleration of the visible universe, we can then solve to position of the "universe core", or: 1.3 x 10^26 m. The order of magnitude of the latter is exactly the same as the order of magnitude of the radius of the visible universe as deduced by mainstream science.

3.5) Regarding the Earth's tides here I'm showing using a software and multiple micro-gal measurements that around the planet that there is a difference with the prediction and the measurements so that means a gravimeter at 6 pm in the afternoon will not measure the same thing as a gravimeter at 6 am in the morning because the gravimeter is either perpendicular or aligning with the Sun and the prediction and the residual actually is very proportional to the derivative of the gravity prediction so it's that means the residual is very consistent with the fact that the gravimeter is either perpendicular or aligned with the Sun. Which means there is obviously aether or a superposed comoving gravitational framework so that's evidence right there that there there is aether. Lastly an important sidenote that in my paper, I refer to another paper showing the flyby anomaly is also proportional to the alignment of the Earth relative to the Sun.

3.6) The light bending here compared with Newton is exactly the same as predicted by General Relativity or twice what Newton predicted predicted for the angle of the light bending.

3.7) Regarding the black holes with Finite Theory, black holes have a maximum mass density so there's no singularity and when two black holes collide then you'll create a bigger aggregate black hole but it's not going to be another Singularity. This was proven in 2021 that two black holes colliding will gain in mass and size so this is exactly what matches the observation and what Stephen Hawking was predicting as well so this another another disproof of General Relativity that mainstream scientists silently dismisses.

3.8) With the galactic rotation curve equation I've shown earlier, Finite Theory is able to reverse engineer the rotation curve of all pretty much all the galaxies. By reverse engineering the rotation curve I'm able to figure the maximum fudge factor that the Galaxy is with it's around 1 x 10^20 kg/m. So that's how that's how I'm able to say the maximum mass of the universe can be and with the maximum radius of the universe can be also. Because the fudge factor of the Milky Way cannot be greater than the fudge factor of the cluster which in turn cannot be greater than the fudge factor of the supercluster which in turn cannot be greater than the fudge factor of the universe so and so on. The rotation curves are very consistent so there's no big mystery here also. The superposed comoving gravitational framework actually says that you have the stars spinning around the core of the galaxy but the bulge itself is also spinning because of its mass. So again what we've been deducing as dark matter for so long it's just a matter of adding the spin to the galaxy and it solves the problem.

3.9) The expansion of the universe here we see that using the Newton or the dark red is faster at the beginning but is actually slowing down. By using Finite Theory the time contraction actually speeds up the expansion of the the galaxies so it ends up that the race has been being won by Finite Theory here by who reaches the greater distance faster because of the time contraction. Again the galaxies are expanding faster and faster because of the time contractions so that that removes the need for dark energy right there. So it expands really because of the time contraction not dark energy.

3.10) The inflation of the universe here is a similar to General Relativity except that the universe itself is traveling through a gravitational potential differencial, as previously stated, so that makes the universe expand because of the time contraction but you also need to add the gravitational redshift and what we thought that the inflation of the universe were you were losing his energy, really is the fact that the visible universe is red shifting is electromagnetic energy and converting it into a gravitoelectromagnetic energy. So it's very simple: the universe has a speed, which would make sense, and the gravitational redshift makes it apparently losing electromagnetic energy.

4) So regarding the gravitomagnetic field here's a real abduction of Travis Walton as shown in the movie "Fire in the Sky". So it's really a gravitomagnetic beam that induces a gravitoelectric beam that propels Travis Walton up from the ground and also from that abduction scene it was it was said that the trees surrounding the abduction area grew faster then what was a than other places so it's really a contraction in time that puts the trees on fast forward and speeds up their growth. So it's by playing with gravity you can play with time rates so you can you can easily accelerate the growth of the trees or vice-versa. 

5) Also using a gravitomagnetic field you can create a force field by stopping anything from reaching you you can by dilating time you can stop anything, including lasers, even nuclear bombs, missiles pretty much everything from colliding with you.

6) You can create tractor beams to freeze entire vehicles from traveling and, you know, put them on hold and freeze everything within that vehicle.

7) And you can also create, what I call, "blink drives" by contracting time you can speed up time within an artificial tunnel and you know you can travel faster than the speed of light very easily. But please note that a gravitomagnetic field loses energy relative to the distance. Therefore to create such astronomical artificial tunnels, we would need new technologies such a gasers and which, similarly to lasers, wouldn't lose energy relative to the distance.

8) So yeah thanks for your time I really appreciate and if you have questions please go ahead. Thank you.
